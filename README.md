# Code-Refactoring-Performance-Optimization

üßÆ Overview

Matrix Calculator is a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, designed to simplify common matrix operations through an intuitive graphical interface. Whether you're a student, educator, or engineer working with linear algebra, this tool streamlines complex calculations and reduces manual errors.

‚ú® Features

Matrix Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimensions element-wise.

Scalar Multiplication: Multiply all elements of a matrix by a constant.

Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two compatible matrices using standard matrix rules.

Transpose: Transpose a matrix across its diagonal.

Determinant Calculation: Compute the determinant of a square matrix.

Inverse Calculation: Find the inverse of a square matrix (if it exists).

Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for better visibility.

Operation History: Keep track of all operations during a session.

Export History: Save session history as .txt or .csv.

Clear History: Erase all operation history with a click.

Splash Screen: Brief animated welcome screen on startup.

üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The GUI is clean and user-friendly. Users can input matrix dimensions and values via dialog boxes. Results are displayed in responsive pop-up windows. The theme auto-adjusts based on user preference (light or dark mode).
